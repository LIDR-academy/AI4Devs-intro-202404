# STOP WATCH

We need to create a web application using an /index.html, /style.css, and /script.js. 

This application should be like the image below. 

StopWatch application must be have exactly buttons found in the image below, also the time must be shown in the center of the screen. 

Must be similar to the image below, make sure the buttons are exactly the same size and shape. 

Use CSS Styles and Bootstrap to make the application responsive. 

Starts time must be 00:00:00

Add milliseconds too aligned bottom of seconds label as the image shows like `000`

## HOW IT WORKS

1. Start button must start the stopwatch
2. Stop button must stop the stopwatch
3. If Start button if pressed after Stop button, the stopwatch must continue from where it left off
4. Reset button must reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00 and milliseconds to `000`

## STACK

HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Bootstrap, Font Awesome

## OUTPUT

index.html, style.css, script.js
folder structure
