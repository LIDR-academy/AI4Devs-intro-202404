# Create a stopwatch function. 

As a Java Developer,
I want create a stopwatch function in javascript,
so that I can stop, start, clear the time.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. The button Start: start the time.
2. The button Clear, reset the counter to zero.
3. Once you click the start button, the next time you click on start, it pauses the counter. At the same time, the button's name changes from 'Start' to 'Stop'.
4. The counter has the format: 'HH:MM:SS'.
5. We only have 2 buttons: 'Start', which is green, and 'Clear', which is red.
6. When 'Start' changes to 'Stop', the color changes from green to orange.
7. If you select 'Stop' again, the action is reversed, and the counter changes back to 'Start'.
8. We have a *principal box*, that is light blue color.
9. In *principal box* we have the numbers 'HH:MM:SS' and milliseconds 'mmm'.
9. The millisecond have the format 'mmm' and apear below to the right of the 'HH:MM:SS' numbers displayed prominently.
10. 'Start' and 'Clear' buttons should be below the *principal box* and alligned each other. 
11. Use javascript best practises.
