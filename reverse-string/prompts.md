You are an expert full-stack developer, and I need your help.
I need to finish the next exercise.

Create a function in JavaScript to invert the order of a string.
For example, if I introduce "AI4Devs", the result must be "sveD4IA".

Please use the following files:

"index.html"

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>    
</head>
<body>
<textarea id="inputText" placeholder="Enter text to reverse"></textarea>
<button onclick="reverseString()">Reverse</button>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

and "script.js" which is currently empty.

Please, use both files to complete the exercise.
I need a text box to introduce the text that we need to invert in the file "index.html" and the logic in the file "script.js".

Could you help me with this?
