# Reverse String Application

## Task Overview
Develop JavaScript code (`script.js`) that not only implements the functionality for a web application to reverse a string in real time but also injects CSS styling directly into the document. This solution will be part of a web application embedded within a given HTML structure, aiming for a clean, modern, responsive, and accessible user interface.

## HTML Structure
The application will utilize the following HTML structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Objectives
1. **Integrated JavaScript Functionality and CSS Styling**: 
   - Use JavaScript to dynamically create UI elements and apply CSS styling for those elements.
   - Implement the real-time string reversal functionality as the user types.

2. **UI Components**:
   - Generate a header with the application title.
   - Create an input field for text entry.
   - Display the reversed string in real-time in a designated area.

3. **Design and User Experience**:
   - Ensure a modern, clean UI with responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
   - Enhance accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Deliverables
**JavaScript Code (`script.js`)**: 
- Dynamically generate the required UI components.
- Inject CSS styles directly into the document's `<head>` for styling these components.
- Implement the string reversal functionality.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The JavaScript should create not only the interactive elements but also style them by appending a `<style>` tag into the document's `<head>`.
- Focus on using vanilla JavaScript and CSS to keep the solution simple and efficient.
- Ensure code clarity through readable, well-commented scripts.
- Apply HTML5 semantic elements for accessibility and structure.
- Utilize CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout to maintain responsiveness across devices.
