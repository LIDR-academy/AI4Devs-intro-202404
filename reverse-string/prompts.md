======

Write a function in Javascript that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of it. For example if I pass "Hello world" it will need to return "dlrow olleH"

=======

Enrich the following html in order to add an input field, a button and a display to show the result of calling the function with the input field as parameter
````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>    
</head>
<body>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
````

=======

NR: I asked ChatGPT an improvement but I did not like the change, so I sticket to the original solution

Could you make the frontend cleaner and pass the string variable as a local variable to the function, rather than retrieving the variables with "document.getElementById". Same with the output

=======

Now, please add a keylistener on the enter key
