Create a html+js website where you input a string up to 100 chars length, click on a button "Reverse ðŸ”„" and below you can see the text reversed. Below, there is a button "Copy ðŸ“‹" that copies the content to the clipboard and shows a plain text "Copied to clipboard!" to the right of the button. Button should only appears once there is reversed text. Styles should be fresh and flat, similar to bootstrap library. Use functions to better decouple and structure the code in script.js
