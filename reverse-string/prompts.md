# Reverse String App Development Journey

Follow the journey of creating a web application for reversing strings, including enhancements and functionalities based on specific prompts.

## Prompts and Enhancements

### 1. Initial App Creation

**Prompt:** Create me an app made with JavaScript and HTML with Bootstrap in which through an input the user enters a phrase or word and return as a result the same string in reverse.

### 2. Adding Copy Functionality

**Prompt:** Create a button in the HTML with which you can copy the string obtained.

### 3. Enhancing Button Understanding with Icons

**Prompt:** Add icons to the buttons to help the understanding of the button.

### 4. Clearing Input After Submission

**Prompt:** When the user submits I want the input to be cleared.

### 5. Conditional Display of Copy Button

**Prompt:** I only want the copy button to appear when I have a result to copy, at the start of the app it should not be displayed.

### 6. Adding a Title to the App

**Prompt:** Add a title to the HTML that reads "Reverse String".

### 7. Adjusting Layout for Result Display

**Prompt:** I want the result to be displayed in HTML on a separate line below the Reverse button and the Copy button to be below the result with a top margin.

### 8. Changing Icons to Emojis

**Prompt:** Can you replace the Font Awesome icons with refresh and copy emojis?

## Conclusion

This document encapsulates the progression of building a simple yet functional Reverse String application, illustrating the incremental enhancements made from the initial concept to the final implementation.

### 9. Creating a Markdown Document

**Prompt:** Can you create a markdown file for me with the prompts I used to get to the final result?

### 10. Modifying the Markdown Document

**Prompt:** I need the .md document to have verbatim the prompts I have provided so that other users can use the same prompts to get a similar result.

### 11. Including Document Creation Prompts

**Prompt:** Include in the document these last two prompts in which I ask you to generate the markdown.
