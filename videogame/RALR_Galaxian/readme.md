# Galaxian Game

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Galaxian game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a player-controlled spaceship that shoots bullets to destroy enemy ships while avoiding collisions. The player's score increases for every enemy ship destroyed and decreases for collisions or when enemy ships reach the bottom of the game area.

## Features

- Player-controlled spaceship movement using arrow keys.
- Continuous shooting while the space bar is held down.
- Enemy ships spawn randomly and move downward.
- Collision detection between player's bullets and enemy ships.
- Collision detection between player's spaceship and enemy ships.
- Game over message with score displayed in the score area.
- Ability to restart the game by pressing the Enter key after game over.
