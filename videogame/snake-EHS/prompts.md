Develop a complete JavaScript Snake game that runs in a web browser. The game should be fully contained within a single HTML file, utilizing inline JavaScript and CSS for simplicity. Here are the detailed requirements and structure for the game:

1. **Game Overview:**
   - The game consists of a snake moving on a grid, controlled by keyboard arrows. The objective is to eat food that randomly appears on the grid without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
   - The snake grows in length each time it eats food, and the game speeds up slightly.
   - The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the grid boundaries.

2. **Technical Requirements:**
   - Use plain JavaScript without external libraries.
   - Implement the game logic and rendering within an HTML file, using `<script>` tags for JavaScript and `<style>` tags for CSS.
   - Ensure compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

3. **Game Components:**
   - A game area represented by a grid.
   - A snake that starts with a length of 3.
   - Food that spawns in random locations on the grid.
   - A score counter displaying the amount of food eaten.

4. **Functionality:**
   - Arrow keys control the snake's direction.
   - The game speeds up incrementally as the snake eats more food.
   - The score updates with each piece of food eaten.
   - Display a "Game Over" message when the game ends, along with the final score.

5. **Styling:**
   - Style the game area and elements minimally but distinguishably. Use contrasting colors for the snake, food, and game area.
   - Ensure the game is visually clear and plays well on a range of screen sizes.

6. **Optimization & Testing:**
   - Code should be well-organized and commented for readability.
   - Test the game for bugs across different browsers to ensure consistent gameplay.

Deliverable: A single HTML file containing all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Snake game. Include inline comments to explain key parts of the game's code and logic.

Please prioritize functionality, readability of code, and adherence to the game specifications outlined above. This project serves as a comprehensive exercise in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML integration, aiming to showcase proficiency in creating interactive web-based games.
