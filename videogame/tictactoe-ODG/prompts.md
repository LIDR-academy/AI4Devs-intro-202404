I want you to act as an experienced software developer and develop a tic-tac-toe game that runs on the web browser with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game should be fully contained within a single HTML file, utilizing inline JavaScript and CSS for simplicity. Here are the detailed requirements:

1. **Technical requirements**
    - Ensure cross-browser compatibility with Chrome, Firefox and Safari
    - Limit the implementation for tablet and desktop devices
    - Center the game in vertical and horizontal direction
2. **Game components**
    - Main 3x3 grid
    - A player display that shows player’s turn
    - A ‘new game’ button for starting a new game at the bottom center of the main grid
    - An ‘undo’ button for resetting the last entered value
3. **Styling**
    - Style the game with Bootstrap library
4. **Functionality**
    - When game loads, it should show an empty grid by 3x3
    - First gamer choose a cell and marks an ‘X’
    - Second gamer choose a cell and marks an ‘O’
    - It continues each turn until one of them achieves a three in a row, cell or diagonal ‘X’ or ‘O’

**Deliverables**:

- One html file with the main structure of the game
- One JavaScript file with the game’s logic
- One CSS file with all the styling
